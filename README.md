### From the Author
Throughout this book, there are benchmarks aimed to demonstrate the relative gain of a
certain performance optimization. The benchmarks results are always dependent on the
underlying hardware, operating system and database server configuration, database size and
concurrency patterns. For this reason, the absolute values are not as important as the relative
optimization gain. In reality, the most relevant benchmark results are the ones against the
actual production system.
